The main.js file uses the Alchemy SDK to retrieve addresses that own NFTs in a given contract. contract "0x01a53B16c3f66F2299d796b2159A0346636a6De8"

The NFT collection can be viewed on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/972combinations

The NFT was made be my personally. It uses Hashlips Layering Engine to create 972 unique NFTs. It was deployed using the NFTPort API.

So far, only one person owns the NFTs in the contract. So running "node main.js" should return only one address.
